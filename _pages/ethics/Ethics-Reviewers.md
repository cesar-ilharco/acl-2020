## Ethics Reviewers
Our initiatives in the CL/NLP community highlights the growing practical importance of our work, and our response to grow more mature in taking responsibility for our creations and research.  It is our view that every reviewer is also an ethics reviewer and that through awareness and practice, all technical reviewers will become competent ethics reviewers, and that eventually the role of a dedicated ethics committee will be obsolete.  

The Ethics Advisory Committee would like to accord thanks to all the technical reviewers who brought ethics issues to the attention of the ethics reviewing team.  We would like to especially thank the below team of ethics reviewers who gave their explicit consent to be listed in this role.  We would also like to thank the ethics reviewers who wished to stay anonymous.
