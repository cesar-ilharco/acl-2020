<h1>Ethics FAQ</h1>
As announced in the call for papers for ACL 2021:<br/>
>Authors are required to honour the ethical code set out in the ACL Code of Ethics. The consideration of the ethical impact of our research, use of data, and potential applications of our work has always been an important consideration, and as artificial intelligence is becoming more mainstream, these issues are increasingly pertinent. We ask that all authors read the code, and ensure that their work is conformant to this code. Where a paper may raise ethical issues, we ask that you include in the paper an explicit discussion of these issues, which will be taken into account in the review process. We reserve the right to reject papers on ethical grounds, where the authors are judged to have operated counter to the code of ethics, or have inadequately addressed legitimate ethical concerns with their work. Indeed, the ACL-IJCNLP 2021 review form includes a section addressing these issues. Papers flagged for ethical concerns by reviewers or ACs will be further reviewed by the Ethic Advisory Committee (EAC).

<p align="justify">This page provides an FAQ about the ethics review process and guidance to authors for how to address ethical considerations in your ACL papers. This applies in the first instance to papers submitted to the main conference (including industry track papers and demo papers). We encourage ACL workshops to follow similar principles.</p>

<h2>How is ACL 2021 handling ethics review?</h2>
Ethics review is handled at several levels:
- In the CFP and this page: information is given concerning what is expected from the authors and reviewers concerning ethics.
- ACL reviewers are asked to consider the points listed in the (ethics review questions page)[https://2021.aclweb.org/ethics/Ethics-review-questions/] and then indicate whether a paper should be flagged for further ethics review and, if so, what considerations lead them to that recommendation.
- A reviewing committee dedicated to ethical issues will review papers flagged by the reviewers or the ACs during the review process. The committee membership will be listed on the ACL 2021 webpage in due course.
- The ethics committee will recommend for each flagged paper whether to (a) accept as is, (b) conditional accept (with specification of what must be addressed for camera-ready), or (c) reject on ethical grounds (with explanation). These judgments will complement, but not replace, review for technical merits from the primary reviewers.
- Camera-ready versions of papers designated as (b) conditional accept will be re-reviewed by the ethics committee to determine whether the concerns have been adequately addressed. If the given conditions are found not to be met, the paper will be rejected. 
- The ethics committee is available to respond to questions from authors about the feedback they have received, regardless of whether the decision was acceptance, conditional acceptance, or rejection on ethical grounds. In the case of (b) conditional accept, the committeeâ€™s goal is to ensure that the authors have the resources to meet the criteria for acceptance. To that end, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the committee with any questions about how to respond to feedback as they prepare their camera-ready submission.
