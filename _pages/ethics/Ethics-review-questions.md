## Ethics Review Questions
We ask that reviewers consider the following questions before answering the portions of the review form concerning ethical considerations. We encourage authors to think through these questions and address them (as appropriate) in their submitted papers. Additional advice to authors is available in the [ACL 2021 Ethics FAQ](https://2021.aclweb.org/ethics/Ethics-FAQ/).

Please note that this is not an exhaustive list of types of ethical issues that can arise, but rather a set of questions meant to help researchers think through possible adverse impacts. Reviewers who spot concerns unrelated to the questions in this list (e.g., experiments whose energy consumption would have significant environmental impact, or a potentially unethical protocol for human subjects research) are encouraged to note them in the review form as well.
