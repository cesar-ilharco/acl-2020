## Ethics Review Questions
We ask that reviewers consider the following questions before answering the portions of the review form concerning ethical considerations. We encourage authors to think through these questions and address them (as appropriate) in their submitted papers. Additional advice to authors is available in the [ACL 2021 Ethics FAQ](https://2021.aclweb.org/ethics/Ethics-FAQ/).
