<h2>Submission Information</h2>
<p align="justify">Following the previous conferences, ACL-IJCNLP 2021 will be open for two 
types of submissions: long and short papers. Author guidelines will be published 
at the conference webpage. Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START 
conference management for both long and short papers.</p>
<h3>Long Papers</h3>
<p align="justify">Long papers must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. 
Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included.</p>
<p align="justify">Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited 
pages of references; final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content 
(up to 9 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.</p>
<p align="justify">Long papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by 
the program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and 
which as poster presentations will be based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. 
There will be no distinction in the proceedings between long papers presented orally and as posters.</p>
<h3>Short Papers</h3>
<p align="justify">ACL-IJCNLP 2021 also solicits short papers. Short paper submissions 
must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a 
shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made 
in a few pages. Some kinds of short papers are:</p>
    - A small, focused contribution <br>
    - A negative result<br>
    - An opinion piece<br>
    - An interesting application nugget<br>
