<p align="justify">The Joint Conference of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational 
Linguistics and the 10th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing 
(ACL-IJCNLP 2021) is currently scheduled to take place in Bangkok, Thailand, during 
August 1-6, 2021. We are monitoring the ongoing global pandemic and will update 
the conference plans (e.g., moving to a virtual or hybrid format) as needed closer to the conference dates.</p>

<p align="justify">ACL-IJCNLP 2021 invites the submission of long and short papers on substantial, 
original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural 
Language Processing. This preliminary call for papers will be updated with more details 
in the first full call for papers and more details will be available on the conference website.</p>

<h2>Submission Information</h2>
<p align="justify">Following the previous conferences, ACL-IJCNLP 2021 will be open for two 
types of submissions: long and short papers. Author guidelines will be published 
at the conference webpage. Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START 
conference management for both long and short papers.</p>
<h3>Long Papers</h3>
<p align="justify">Long papers must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. 
Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included.</p>
<p align="justify">Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited 
pages of references; final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content 
(up to 9 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.</p>
<p align="justify">Long papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by 
the program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and 
which as poster presentations will be based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. 
There will be no distinction in the proceedings between long papers presented orally and as posters.</p>
<h3>Short Papers</h3>
<p align="justify">ACL-IJCNLP 2021 also solicits short papers. Short paper submissions 
must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a 
shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made 
in a few pages. Some kinds of short papers are:</p>
    - A small, focused contribution <br>
    - A negative result<br>
    - An opinion piece<br>
    - An interesting application nugget<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus unlimited 
pages of references. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given five (5) content pages 
in the proceedings. Authors are encouraged to use this additional page to address reviewers' 
comments in their final versions.</p>
<p align="justify">Short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the 
program committee. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, 
there will be no distinction in the proceedings between short papers presented orally and as posters.</p>
<h2>IMPORTANT: Anonymity Period</h2>
<p align="justify">The following rules and guidelines are meant to protect the integrity of double-blind 
review and ensure that submissions are reviewed fairly. The rules make reference to the anonymity 
period, which runs from 1 month before the submission deadline (starting January 1, 2021 11:59PM 
UTC-12:00) up to the date when your paper is either accepted, rejected, or withdrawn (May 5, 2021). 
Papers that are withdrawn during this period will no longer be subject to these rules.</p>

<p align="justify">- You may not make a non-anonymized version of your paper available online to the 
general community (for example, via a preprint server) during the anonymity period. 
By a version of a paper we understand another paper having essentially the same 
scientific content but possibly differing in minor details (including title and structure) and/or in length.</p>
<p align="justify">- If you have posted a non-anonymized version of your paper online before the start of the anonymity 
period, you may submit an anonymized version to the conference. The submitted version 
must not refer to the non-anonymized version, and you must inform the program chair(s) 
that a non-anonymized version exists.</p>
<p align="justify">- You may not update the non-anonymized version during the anonymity 
period, and we ask you not to advertise it on social media or take other actions that would 
further compromise double-blind reviewing during the anonymity period.</p>
<p align="justify">- Note that, while you are not prohibited from making a non-anonymous 
version available online before the start of the anonymity period, this does make double-blind 
reviewing more difficult to maintain, and we therefore encourage you to wait until the end 
of the anonymity period if possible. Alternatively, you may consider submitting your work to 
the Computational Linguistics journal, which does not require anonymization and has a 
track for “short” (i.e., conference-length) papers.</p>
<h2>Multiple Submission Policy</h2>
<p align="justify">ACL-IJCNLP 2021 will not consider any paper that is under review 
in a journal or another conference at the time of submission, and submitted papers 
must not be submitted elsewhere during the ACL-IJCNLP 2021 review period. 
This policy covers all refereed and archival conferences and workshops (e.g., IJCAI, SIGIR, NAACL). </p>
<p align="justify">In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content 
or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Authors submitting more 
than one paper to ACL-IJCNLP 2021 must ensure that submissions do not overlap significantly 
(>25%) with each other in content or results.</p>
