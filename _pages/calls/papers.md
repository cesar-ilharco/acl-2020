 <h2>SUBMISSIONS</h2>
<b>Long papers</b><br>
<p>ACL-IJCNLP 2021 submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis 
should be included. Submissions will be judged on appropriateness, clarity, originality/innovativeness, correctness/soundness, meaningful comparison, thoroughness, 
significance, contributions to research resources, and replicability. Each submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members.</p>
<p>Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus two pages for references; final versions of long papers will be given one additional page 
(up to 9 pages with 2 pages for references) so that reviewers’comments can be taken into account.<p>
<p>Long papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally 
and which as poster presentations will be based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. There will be no distinction in the proceedings between long 
papers presented orally and as posters.</p><br>
<b>Short papers</b><br>
<p>ACL-IJCNLP 2021 also solicits short papers. Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work.  Please note that a short paper is not a 
shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages. Characteristics of short papers include:</p>
    » A small, focused contribution<br>
    » Work in progress<br>
    » A negative result<br>
    » An opinion piece<br>
    » An interesting application nugget<br><br>
<p>Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus 2 pages for references. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given five (5) pages in the proceedings 
and 2 pages for references. Authors are encouraged to use this additional page to address reviewers comments in their final versions.</p>
<p>Short papers will be presented in one or more oral or poster sessions. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no 
distinction in the proceedings between short papers presented orally and posters. Each short paper submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members.</p>
<br><br>
<b>Both long and short papers</b>
<p>Papers should not refer, for further detail, to papers that are not available to the reviewers. Papers may be accompanied by the resource (software and/or data) described 
in the paper. Papers that are submitted with accompanying software/data may receive additional credit toward the overall evaluation score, and the potential impact of the 
software and data will be taken into account when making the acceptance/rejection decisions.</p>
<p>ACL-IJCNLP 2021 also allows for submitting supplementary material. This should be supplementary (rather than central) to the paper. It may include explanations 
or details of proofs or derivations that do not fit into the paper, lists of features or feature templates, sample inputs and outputs for a system, pseudo-code or source code, 
and data. The paper should not rely on the supplementary material: while the paper may refer to and cite the supplementary material and the supplementary material will be 
available to reviewers, they will not be asked to review or even download the supplementary material. </p>
<br><br>
<h2>FORMAT</h2>
<p>Long paper submissions must follow the two-column format of ACL-IJCNLP 2021 proceedings without exceeding eight (8) pages of content plus two extra pages 
for references. Short paper submissions must also follow the two-column format of ACL-IJCNLP 2021 proceedings, and must not exceed four (4) pages plus at most 
2 pages for references. We strongly recommend the use of ACL LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word style files tailored for this year's conference. Submissions must conform 
to the official style guidelines, which are contained in the style files, and they must be in PDF.</p>
<p>As the reviewing will be blind, papers must not include authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., 
"We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." Papers that do not conform 
to these requirements will be rejected without review. In addition, please do not post your submissions on the web until after the review process is complete.</p>
