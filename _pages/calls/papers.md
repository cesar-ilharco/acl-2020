<h2>ACL-IJCNLP 2021 Theme Track: NLP for Social Good (NLP4SG)</h2>
<p align="justify">
The application of Artificial Intelligence to provide positive social impact has been 
an important topic in recent years. However, to date, this has not been a topic 
highlighted at the ACL main conference. For ACL-IJCNLP 2021, we seek to reverse 
this by putting a spotlight on papers which discuss and reflect on the topic of NLP 
for Social Good as well as how NLP could potentially cause or be used for social harm. 
We invite researchers to submit position, opinion, modeling, and resource papers on the following topics:</p>
- Defining "NLP for Social Good" and in which ways NLP can improve people's lives in various dimensions<br/>
- Known issues, unaddressed harms, and potential damages that NLP can cause on society (e.g., political polarization, privacy issues)<br/>
- Discussions of how NLP research can make both positive and negative impacts and novel approaches to foster the former while mitigating the latter<br/>
- Quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the social impact of NLP research<br/>
- Ways in which NLP practitioners can partner with practitioners from other fields to develop socially impactful research and applications<br/>
- Applications of NLP for addressing socially relevant problems such as health, education, and other areas covered by (and not limited to) the 
UN Sustainable Development Goals. Please note that the paper should provide evidence of the 
methodology applied to a real-world setting. At the least, one should simulate the real-world 
setting that the system is meant to improve.<br/>
- Reflecting on the NLP community's current progress for solving real-world, socially impactful 
problems and how to make meaningful changes toward that goal over the foreseeable future<br/>
- Discussions of how heavily aligned NLP research should be with real-world topics regarding social good.<br/>

<h2>PAPER SUBMISSION INFORMATION</h2>
<h3>Long Papers</h3>
<p align="justify">Long papers must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. 
Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included.</p>
<p align="justify">Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited 
pages of references. Final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content 
(up to 9 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.</p>
<p align="justify">Long papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the 
program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and which 
as poster presentations will be based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. 
There will be no distinction in the proceedings between long papers presented orally and as posters.</p>
<h3>Short Papers</h3>
Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short 
paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made 
in a few pages. Some kinds of short papers are:<br/><br/>
- A small, focused contribution <br/>
- A negative result<br/>
- An opinion piece<br/>
- An interesting application nugget<br/>

<p align="justify">Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus unlimited pages 
of references. Final versions of short papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 5 pages) 
so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.</p>
<p align="justify">Short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the 
program committee. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, 
there will be no distinction in the proceedings between short papers presented orally and as posters.</p>
Review forms will be made available prior to the deadlines.
<br>
<h3>IMPORTANT: Anonymity Period</h3>
<p align="justify">Following the success of the ACL 2020 Theme track, we are happy to announce 
that ACL-IJCNLP 2021 will have a new theme, with the goal of stimulating discussion about the role 
of NLP in the society.</p>
<p align="justify">The following rules and guidelines are meant to protect the integrity of double-blind 
review and ensure that submissions are reviewed fairly. The rules make reference to the anonymity 
period, which runs from 1 month before the submission deadline (starting January 1, 2021 11:59PM 
UTC-12:00) up to the date when your paper is either accepted, rejected, or withdrawn (May 5, 2021). 
Papers that are withdrawn during this period will no longer be subject to these rules.</p>

- You may not make a non-anonymized version of your paper available online to the 
general community (for example, via a preprint server) during the anonymity period. 
By a version of a paper we understand another paper having essentially the same 
scientific content but possibly differing in minor details (including title and structure) and/or in length.<br/>
- If you have posted a non-anonymized version of your paper online before the start of the anonymity 
period, you may submit an anonymized version to the conference. The submitted version 
must not refer to the non-anonymized version, and you must inform the program chair(s) 
that a non-anonymized version exists.<br/>
- You may not update the non-nonymized version during the anonymity 
period, and we ask you not to advertise it on social media or take other actions that would 
further compromise double-blind reviewing during the anonymity period.<br/>
- Note that, while you are not prohibited from making a non-anonymous 
version available online before the start of the anonymity period, this does make double-blind 
reviewing more difficult to maintain, and we therefore encourage you to wait until the end 
of the anonymity period if possible. Alternatively, you may consider submitting your work to 
the Computational Linguistics journal, which does not require anonymization and has a 
track for "short" (i.e., conference-length) papers.<br/>

<h3>Instructions for Double-Blind Review</h3>
<p align="justify">As the reviewing will be blind, papers must not include authors' names and affiliations. 
Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." 
must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." Papers that 
do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.</p>
<p align="justify">Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents that are not available 
to the reviewers. For example, do not omit or redact important citation information to preserve 
anonymity. Instead, use third person or named reference to this work, as described above 
("Smith showed" rather than "we showed").</p>
<p align="justify">Papers may be accompanied by a resource (software and/or data) described 
in the paper, but these resources should be anonymized as well.</p>
<h3>Authorship</h3>
<p align="justify">The author list for submissions should include all (and only) individuals 
who made substantial contributions to the work presented. Each author listed on a submission 
to ACL-IJCNLP 2021 will be notified of submissions, revisions and the final decision. 
No changes to the order or composition of authorship may be made to submissions to 
ACL-IJCNLP 2021 after the abstract submission deadline, which is January 25, 2011.</p>
<h3>Citation and Comparison</h3>
<p align="justify">You are expected to cite all refereed publications relevant to your submission, 
but you may be excused for not knowing about all unpublished work (especially work that has 
been recently posted and/or is not widely cited).</p>
<p align="justify">In cases where a preprint has been superseded by a refereed publication, 
the refereed publication should be cited in addition to or instead of the preprint version.</p>
<p align="justify">Papers (whether refereed or not) appearing less than 3 months before the 
submission deadline are considered contemporaneous to your submission, and you are therefore 
not obliged to make detailed comparisons that require additional experimentation and/or in-depth analysis.</p>
For more information, see the [ACL Policies for Submission, Review, and Citation](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Policies_for_Submission,_Review_and_Citation).

<h2>Multiple Submission Policy</h2>
<p align="justify">ACL-IJCNLP 2021 will not consider any paper that is under review 
in a journal or another conference at the time of submission, and submitted papers 
must not be submitted elsewhere during the ACL-IJCNLP 2021 review period. 
This policy covers all refereed and archival conferences and workshops (e.g., IJCAI, SIGIR, NAACL).
We make an exception to the above: papers can be dual-submitted to both ACL-IJCNLP 2021 
and an ACL-IJCNLP 2021 workshop which has its submission deadline falling before our 
notification date of May 5, 2021.</p> 
<p align="justify">In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly 
in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Authors 
submitting more than one paper to ACL-IJCNLP 2021 must ensure that submissions do not 
overlap significantly (>25%) with each other in content or results.</p>
<h2>Ethics Policy</h2>
<p align="justify">Authors are required to honour the ethical code set out in the X
[ACL Code of Ethics](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-code-ethics).
The consideration of the ethical impact of our research, use of data, and potential applications of our 
work has always been an important consideration, and as artificial intelligence is becoming more 
mainstream, these issues are increasingly pertinent. We ask that all authors read the code, and 
ensure that their work is conformant to this code. Where a paper may raise ethical issues, we ask 
that you include in the paper an explicit discussion of these issues, which will be taken into account 
in the review process. We reserve the right to reject papers on ethical grounds, where the authors 
are judged to have operated counter to the code of ethics, or have inadequately addressed legitimate 
ethical concerns with their work.</p>
