##  Call For System Demonstrations

The system demonstration track at ACL-IJCNLP 2021 is a venue for papers describing system demonstrations, ranging from early prototypes to mature production-ready systems. Publicly available open-source or open-access systems are of special interest.

All accepted demos are published in a companion volume of the conference proceedings. We expect at least one of the authors to present a live demo during a demo session at ACL-IJCNLP  2021, with an accompanying poster.

Submissions will undergo a single-blind reviewing process. So papers may include author and affiliation information, and freely make references to previously published material, and URLs.

This year we are incorporating ethical considerations in the review process. Authors will be allowed extra unlimited space after the main content for a broader impact statement or other discussion of ethics. Please review the ethics policy before submitting


### Areas of Interest 

Areas of interest include all topics related to theoretical and applied computational linguistics, such as (but not limited to) the topics listed on the main conference website. Submitted systems may be of the following types:

» Natural Language Processing systems or system components<br>
» Application systems using language technology components<br>
» Software tools for computational linguistics research<br>
» Software for analysis, demonstration or evaluation<br>
» Software supporting learning or education<br>
» Tools for data visualization and annotation<br>
» Development tools<br>

**Please note:** Commercial sales and marketing activities are not appropriate in the Demonstrations Program

## Best Demo Award

As in previous years, ACL-IJCNLP 2021's demo track will feature a Best Demo Award. We hope to encourage researchers to make their code publicly available and in the form of an easy-to-use, runnable system.

## Demo Details

Developers should outline the design of their system and provide sufficient details to allow the evaluation of its validity, quality, and relevance to computational linguistics.

To ensure accessibility for deaf or hard-of-hearing viewers, we encourage authors to caption videos prior to submission. Pointers to web sites running a demo preview will also be helpful. For non web-based demos, it is possible to submit a short (~2 minute) screencast video demonstrating the system. This screencast will be used to evaluate the paper, but won’t be published unless requested. We encourage the authors to include visual aids (e.g., screenshots, snapshots, or diagrams) in the paper. Authors will also be able to upload and submit additional material, if needed.  If you choose to submit a screencast, please upload the video to some hosting site (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.) and include the link in your paper submission.

Upon acceptance, demo submissions should also clearly indicate if any computer equipment is expected to be provided by the local organizer. Also, please specify in you submission, the desired hardware platform, hard disk and memory capacity, operating system and other software needed in order to run the demo

## Reviewing Policy

Reviewing will be single-blind, so authors do not need to conceal their identity. The paper should include the authors’ names and affiliations. Self-references are also allowed.
