<span style="font-weight: bolder;font-size: larger;">Call for Tutorial Proposals ACL-IJCNLP 2021</span>

## SUBMISSION DETAILS

Proposals should not exceed 6 pages, should be submitted as PDF documents and should contain the following:

» A title, authors and a brief description of the tutorial content and its relevance to the computational linguistics community (no more than 2 pages).<br>
» Type of the tutorial: introductory vs. cutting-edge<br>
» A brief outline of the tutorial structure. It should notably show that the core content can be covered in a three-hour slot. In exceptional cases six-hour tutorial slots are available as well. These time limits do not include coffee breaks, e.g., a three-hour tutorial in fact occupies a 3.5-hour slot, and a six-hour tutorial occupies a 7-hour slot.<br>
» Breadth: include an estimate of what % of the tutorial covers work by the tutorial  presenters vs. work by other researchers. We ask for a coverage of at least 50% corresponding to other people’s work, in order to avoid having tutorials that are “self-invited talks”.<br>
» Diversity considerations (if any), e.g. use of multilingual data, indications of how the described methods scale up to various languages or domains, participation of both senior and junior instructors, possibly affiliated in different countries, gender balance of the instructors, etc.<br>
» Specification of any prerequisites for the attendees. Here are some examples:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Math: e.g., “Understand derivatives and integrals as found in introductory Calculus”<br>
    + Linguistics: e.g., “Be able to parse and generate text with Context Free Grammars”<br>
    + Machine Learning: e.g., “Understand ‘classical’ supervised methods such as decision trees and Naive Bayes”<br>
    + Other areas: e.g., “Familiarity with WordNet”<br>
    + Programming or other tools: e.g., “Knowledge of Python and Unix command line tools”<br>
» Small reading list. It's size should be such that it is reasonable to expect a trainee to read most of the recommended references before the tutorial (depending on their length, 4-10 seems a reasonable number). Preferably, at least 50% of the recommended papers should not be co-authored by the tutorial presenters.<br>
» The names, affiliations, email addresses and websites of the tutorial presenters, including a one-paragraph statement of their research interests, areas of expertise and experience in teaching for an international audience.<br>
» An estimate of the audience size for the tutorial. If the same or a similar tutorial has been given before, include a note specifying where previous versions of the tutorial were given, how many attendees were at the main venue, and how many attendees the tutorial attracted.<br>
» A description of special requirements for technical equipment (e.g., Internet access).<br>
» Open access. Do you agree to allow the publication of your slides and video recording of your tutorial in the ACL Anthology? Will other teaching material (data, software, etc., if any) be openly available?<br>

## EVALUATION CRITERIA

Each tutorial proposal will be evaluated according to its clarity and preparedness, novelty or timely character of the topic, instructors' experience, 
likely audience interest, open access of the teaching material, and diversity aspects.
