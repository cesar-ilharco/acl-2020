## Tutorial Details

The following tutorials have been accepted for ACL-IJCNLP 2021 and will be held on Sunday, August 1th, 2021. 
		
### T1: Advances in Debating Technologies: Building AI That Can Debate Humans (3 Hours) <br/>
*Organizers: Roy Bar-Haim, Liat Ein-Dor, Matan Orbach and Noam Slonim*

The tutorial focuses on Debating Technologies, a sub-field of computational argumentation defined as "computational technologies developed directly to enhance, support, and engage with human debating" (Gurevych et al., 2016). A recent milestone in this field is Project Debater, which was revealed in 2019 as the first AI system that can debate human experts on complex topics. Project Debater is the third in the series of IBM Research AI's grand challenges, following Deep Blue and Watson. It has been developed for over six years by a large team of NLP and ML researchers and engineers, and its live demonstration in February 2019 received massive media attention. This research effort has resulted in more than 50 scientific papers to date, and many datasets freely available for research purposes. We discuss the scientific challenges that arise when building such a system, including argument mining, argument quality assessment, stance classification, principled argument detection, narrative generation, and rebutting a human opponent. Many of the underlying capabilities of Project Debater will become freely available for academic research starting April 2021, and the tutorial will include a detailed explanation of how to use and leverage these tools.

A complementary goal of the tutorial is to provide a holistic view of a debating system. Such a view is largely missing in the academic literature, where each paper typically addresses a specific problem in isolation. We present a complete pipeline of a debating system, and discuss the information flow and the interaction between the various components. Finally, we discuss practical applications and future challenges of debating technologies. 

### T2: Event-Centric Natural Language Understanding (3.5 Hours)
*Instructors: Muhao Chen, Hongming Zhang, Qiang Ning, Manling Li, Heng Ji, Kathleen McKeown and Dan Roth*
   
This tutorial targets researchers and practitioners who are interested in AI technologies that help machines understand natural language text, particularly real-world events described in the text. These include methods to extract the internal structures of an event regarding its protagonist(s), participant(s) and properties, as well as external structures concerning memberships, temporal and causal relations of multiple events. This tutorial will provide audience with a systematic introduction of (i) knowledge representations and acquisition of events, (ii) various methods for automated extraction, conceptualization, coreference resolution and prediction of events and their relations, (iii) induction of event processes and properties, and (iv) a wide range of NLU and commonsense understanding tasks that benefit from aforementioned techniques. We will conclude the tutorial by outlining emerging research problems in this area. 

### T3: Meta Learning and Its Applications to Natural Language Processing (3 Hours)
*Instructors: Hung-yi Lee, Ngoc Thang Vu, Shang-Wen Li*
  
Deep learning based natural language processing (NLP) has become the mainstream of research in recent years and significantly outperforms conventional methods. However, deep learning models are notorious for being data and computation hungry. These downsides limit such modelsâ€™ application from deployment to different domains, languages, countries, or styles, since collecting in-genre data and model training from scratch are costly. The long-tail nature of human language makes challenges even more significant.
Meta-learning, or 'Learning to Learn', aims to learn better learning algorithms, including better parameter initialization, optimization strategy, network architecture, distance metrics, and beyond. Meta-learning has been shown to allow faster fine tuning, converge to better performance, and achieve outstanding results for few-shot learning in many applications. Meta-learning is one of the most important new techniques in machine learning in recent years. There is a related tutorial in ICML 20191 and a related course at Stanford2, but most of the example applications given in these materials are about image processing. It is believed that meta learning has excellent potential to be applied in NLP, and some works have been proposed with notable achievements in several relevant problems, e.g., relation extraction, machine translation, and dialogue generation and state tracking. However, it does not catch the same level of attention as in the image processing community. 

In the tutorial, we will first introduce Meta learning approaches and the theory behind them, and then review the works of applying this technology to NLP problems. This tutorial intends to facilitate researchers in the NLP community to understand this new technology better and promote more research studies using this new technology.

### T4: Pre-training Methods for Neural Machine Translation (3 hours) 

*Instructors: MingxuanWang, Lei Li* 

This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to make the most of pre-training for neural machine translation, including multilingual NMT and speech NMT. Firstly, we will briefly introduce the background of NMT, pre-training methodology, and point out the main challenges when applying pre-training for NMT. Then we will focus on analyzing the role of pre-training in enhancing the performance of NMT, how to design a better pretraining model for executing specific NMT tasks and how to better integrate the pre-trained model into NMT system. In each part, we will provide examples, discuss training techniques and analyze what is transferred when applying pre-training.
