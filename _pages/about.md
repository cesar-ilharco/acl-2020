ranking (for 2016). Euromonitor International ranked Bangkok fourth in its Top City Destinations Ranking for 2016. Bangkok was also named "World's Best City" 
by Travel and Leisure magazine's survey of its readers for four consecutive years, from 2010 to 2013. </p>

<p>Bangkok's multi-faceted sights, attractions and city life appeal to diverse groups of tourists. Royal palaces and temples as well as several museums constitute its major 
historical and cultural tourist attractions. Shopping and dining experiences offer a wide range of choices and prices. Among Bangkok's well-known sights are the Grand Palace 
and major Buddhist temples, including Wat Phra Kaew, Wat Pho, and Wat Arun. The Giant Swing and Erawan Shrine demonstrate Hinduism's deep-rooted influence in Thai culture.
Vimanmek Mansion in Dusit Palace is famous as the world's largest teak building, while the Jim Thompson House provides an example of traditional Thai architecture. 
Other major museums include the Bangkok National Museum and the Royal Barge National Museum. Cruises and boat trips on the Chao Phraya and Thonburi's canals 
offer views of some of the city's traditional architecture and ways of life on the waterfront.	</p>

Ratchaprasong to the sprawling Chatuchak Weekend Market. Taling Chan Floating Market is among the few such markets in Bangkok. Yaowarat is known 
for its shops as well as street-side food stalls and restaurants, which are also found throughout the city. Khao San Road has long been famous as a destination 
for backpacker tourism, with its budget accommodation, shops and bars attracting visitors from all over the world</p>	
<p><b><u>Getting Around in Bangkok</u></b></p>
<p>Bangkok is surprisingly easy to navigate your way around. The Skytrain (BTS) and underground (MRT) rail systems connect the main shopping, 
entertainment and business areas of the city, while river taxis and express boats can be used to explore many historic sites and attractions at the riverside. </p>
