<h2>About Bangkok</h2><br>
<p>Bangkok is one of the world's top tourist destinations. Of 162 cities worldwide, MasterCard ranked Bangkok as the top destination city by international 
visitor arrivals in its Global Destination Cities Index 2018, ahead of London, with just over 20 million overnight visitors in 2017. This was a repeat of its 2017 
ranking (for 2016). Euromonitor International ranked Bangkok fourth in its Top City Destinations Ranking for 2016. Bangkok was also named "World's Best City" 
by Travel and Leisure magazine's survey of its readers for four consecutive years, from 2010 to 2013. </p>

<p>As the main gateway through which visitors arrive in Thailand, Bangkok is visited by the majority of international tourists to the country. Domestic tourism is also prominent. 
The Department of Tourism recorded 26,861,095 Thai and 11,361,808 foreign visitors to Bangkok in 2010. Lodgings were made by 15,031,244 guests, who occupied 49.9 percent 
of the city's 86,687 hotel rooms. Bangkok also topped the list as the world's most popular tourist destinations in 2017 rankings.</p>

<p>Bangkok's multi-faceted sights, attractions and city life appeal to diverse groups of tourists. Royal palaces and temples as well as several museums constitute its major 
historical and cultural tourist attractions. Shopping and dining experiences offer a wide range of choices and prices. Among Bangkok's well-known sights are the Grand Palace 
and major Buddhist temples, including Wat Phra Kaew, Wat Pho, and Wat Arun. The Giant Swing and Erawan Shrine demonstrate Hinduism's deep-rooted influence in Thai culture.
Vimanmek Mansion in Dusit Palace is famous as the world's largest teak building, while the Jim Thompson House provides an example of traditional Thai architecture. 
Other major museums include the Bangkok National Museum and the Royal Barge National Museum. Cruises and boat trips on the Chao Phraya and Thonburi's canals 
offer views of some of the city's traditional architecture and ways of life on the waterfront.	</p>

<p>Shopping venues, many of which are popular with both tourists and locals, range from the shopping centres and department stores concentrated in Siam and 
Ratchaprasong to the sprawling Chatuchak Weekend Market. Taling Chan Floating Market is among the few such markets in Bangkok. Yaowarat is known 
for its shops as well as street-side food stalls and restaurants, which are also found throughout the city. Khao San Road has long been famous as a destination 
for backpacker tourism, with its budget accommodation, shops and bars attracting visitors from all over the world</p>	
<p><b><u>Getting Around in Bangkok</u></b></p>
<p>Bangkok is surprisingly easy to navigate your way around. The Skytrain (BTS) and underground (MRT) rail systems connect the main shopping, 
entertainment and business areas of the city, while river taxis and express boats can be used to explore many historic sites and attractions at the riverside. </p>

<p>Taxis are cheap and appear on virtually every corner at almost any time. Tuk-tuks, once a big Bangkok attraction, are slowly disappearing in favour of more 
comfortable transport, but are still worth a ride at least once. Most buses might be slow and old, but a great way to travel with locals and get a real feel of the city.  
Another option is motorbike taxis. They're fast and efficient, but not for everyone. There is, of course, always the humble bicycle too - perhaps not the safest option, 
and strictly for the adventurous.</p>
<p><b><u>Weather</u></b></p>
<p>Bangkok is a tropical city that sits just north of the equator, and so it's pretty warm throughout the year. At times the heat can be oppressive. </p>

<p>If your especially adverse to extreme temperatues, avoid between April and May when the weather is especially hot and sticky (temperatures around 34C). 
However, don't fret if you do choose to come then: one of Thailand's most celebrated festivals, Songkran, takes place in April and involves lots of 
refreshing water throwing to help cool everyone down. Perhaps the best time to visit is from October until February, when temperatures hover between 25 and 28C 
and there are light breezes and only occasional showers. From June through to September there's still plenty of sunshine and it's much cooler (around 24-28 C). 
Remember though, this is the season for rain and there can lots of it. However, this is actually quite refreshing! Others advantages are less visitors and better hotel rates.</p>
