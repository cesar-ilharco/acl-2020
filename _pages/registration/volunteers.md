Call for Volunteers

Submission Deadline: Wednesday, **30 June 2021**

## VOLUNTEER/SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM

We seek student and non-student volunteers for the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2021). In exchange for one full day equivalent of work, students receive free registration to the main conference (including workshops and tutorials) and ACL membership. Non-student volunteers also receive free registration to the main conference (including workshops and tutorials) and must pay membership if not already a current 2021 member. 

As ACL 2021 will be virtual, volunteer tasks will be different from previous years. We are seeking volunteers to help us in the following tasks:
- organize video presentations,
- act as technical host for live video Q&A sessions, and
- provide assistance for conference events including tutorials, the main conference, and workshops (including the student research workshop).

As we will receive most of the presentations prior to the conference, a large portion of the tasks will be done in advance, maximizing volunteer access to the conference events.

### SELECTION CRITERIA

Applicants for the Volunteer/scholarship Program will be evaluated based on the material they submit in their application packages (see below for the submission requirements). Preference will be given to students who are presenting a paper in the main conference, the Student Research Workshop, or any of the associated workshops and do not have other means of support.

### SUBMISSION PROCEDURE

Applicants for the Volunteer/scholarship Program should fill the application form below:
