Call for Volunteers

Submission Deadline: Wednesday, 30 June 2021

VOLUNTEER/SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM

We seek student and non-student volunteers for the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2021). In exchange for one full day equivalent of work, students receive free registration to the main conference (including workshops and tutorials) and ACL membership. Non-student volunteers also receive free registration to the main conference (including workshops and tutorials) and must pay membership if not already a current 2021 member.
