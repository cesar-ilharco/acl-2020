These instructions are adapted from the ones for ACL 2020, EMNLP 2020, and NAACL 2021.

To submit your camera-ready version, please go to the softconf site, click the submission id, and then click "Final Camera Ready Submission". This document is organized based on the sections in the Final Submission Page. Please note that the following applies to the ACL-IJCNLP main conference papers and Findings of ACL papers. It will also apply to ACL-IJCNLP workshop papers unless the workshops have their own instructions.
