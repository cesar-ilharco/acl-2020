These instructions are adapted from the ones for ACL 2020, EMNLP 2020, and NAACL 2021.

To submit your camera-ready version, please go to the softconf site, click the submission id, and then click "Final Camera Ready Submission". This document is organized based on the sections in the Final Submission Page. Please note that the following applies to the ACL-IJCNLP main conference papers and Findings of ACL papers. It will also apply to ACL-IJCNLP workshop papers unless the workshops have their own instructions.

Please remember to use the template files for the conference and follow the instructions in this document. In addition, you need to run a tool called aclpub_check developed by the NAACL2021 publication chairs to automate the checking for some frequently encountered formatting issues. For details of the tool, see Section 3 and the Appendix. Camera-ready copies that fail to meet these instructions will be returned for re-submission. 

## 1. Metadata (Part A in the final submission form)
### Can I make changes to the author list in the camera-ready version?
No, you cannot change the author list, as explained in the FAQ at https://2021.aclweb.org/blog/faq-decision/ 
In fact, the authors' field will not be editable in the final submission form.

### How should I enter metadata on the START system?
The metadata (title, author, abstract) that you enter into START is very important, because it is used on the conference website, proceedings, handbook, mobile app, and the ACL Anthology (and propagates to Google Scholar, etc.).

Before the metadata is entered, please have all authors ensure that the name in their START profile (User Console, Update Profile) appears exactly the way that they want it to appear. 
- Unicode (UTF-8) can be used for accented or special characters.
- Ordinarily, names are NOT written in all caps or all lowercase.
- The "Last Name" is the name(s) by which your paper is to be cited. It is usually a family name, even for authors from cultures where the family name is written first.
- The "First Name" is usually a given name or names, including middle names/initials.
