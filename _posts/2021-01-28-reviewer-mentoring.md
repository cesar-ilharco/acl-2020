### Rationale for the reviewer mentoring program survey
ACL-IJCNLP'21 will provide a mentoring program service to first-time reviewers. We are about to publish detailed information on this blog in the upcoming few days. In today's blog post we want to share with the community a survey we conducted towards Senior Area Chairs and Area Chairs. During our mentoring program preparations, we asked SACs and ACs what they expect of reviews, including impact of code, appendices and data, the expected reviewing time per paper, what they would want to see in a reviewing tutorial video towards first-time reviewers, what they expect from the rebuttal phase.
