## Reproducibility FAQ

### Q1: As an author, am I required to full out the reproducibility checklist in the full-paper submission form? 

A1: Yes. You won't be able to submit the full paper without filling out the reproducibility checklist first. Note that some items in the checklist may not be relevant to your submission. For example, a dataset paper might have no code to be released. In that case, you choose "Not applicable" for those items on the checklist.

### Q2: I have completed the checklist in the submission form. Am I required to address those items explicitly in the submission itself (i.e., in the main paper or supplementary material)?

A2: The items from the checklist are not required to be addressed explicitly in a submission, but authors may find their submissions to be of higher quality if they do so for items that are relevant to their work. Please use your best judgment to determine what checklist items are relevant to your work and what items should be addressed explicitly in the submission itself.
