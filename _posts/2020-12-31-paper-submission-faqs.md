Double Submissions and Anonymity Issues

### Q1: We have submitted our paper to ICLR 2021 and we also have a non-anonymized version on arXiv now. ICLR'2021 will notify us of the final result on January 12, 2021 which is in the anonymity period of ACL-IJCNLP 2021, we wonder if it would be against the anonymous policy if we submit that paper to ACL-IJCNLP 2021 at that time. 

A1: If your paper is no longer under review (e.g., desk rejected, withdrawn) at ICLR before ACL-IJCNLP 2021's submission deadline and your de-anonymized paper is posted before January 1, 2021, you can submit your paper to ACL-IJCNLP 2021. Any de-anonymization after January 1 will not be eligible for re-submission to ACL-IJCNLP 2021.
