Double Submissions and Anonymity Issues

### Q1: We have submitted our paper to ICLR 2021 and we also have a non-anonymized version on arXiv now. ICLR'2021 will notify us of the final result on January 12, 2021 which is in the anonymity period of ACL-IJCNLP 2021, we wonder if it would be against the anonymous policy if we submit that paper to ACL-IJCNLP 2021 at that time. 

A1: If your paper is no longer under review (e.g., desk rejected, withdrawn) at ICLR before ACL-IJCNLP 2021's submission deadline and your de-anonymized paper is posted before January 1, 2021, you can submit your paper to ACL-IJCNLP 2021. Any de-anonymization after January 1 will not be eligible for re-submission to ACL-IJCNLP 2021.

### Q2: Our paper has already been accepted at a workshop. There are no formal proceedings for this workshop. We want to submit our work to ACL-IJCNLP 2021. Do we need to take any special steps to ensure its eligibility for ACL-IJCNLP 2021, for example, to ensure that the workshop does not post the paper online during the anonymity period?

A2: The goal of the anonymity period is to ensure double blind review. Thus, the workshop should not post the paper online during the anonymity period. It would be good that you contact the workshop organizers about this.
