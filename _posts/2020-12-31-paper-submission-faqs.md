## Double Submissions and Anonymity Issues

### Q1: We have submitted our paper to ICLR 2021 and we also have a non-anonymized version on arXiv now. ICLR'2021 will notify us of the final result on January 12, 2021 which is in the anonymity period of ACL-IJCNLP 2021, we wonder if it would be against the anonymous policy if we submit that paper to ACL-IJCNLP 2021 at that time. 

A1: If your paper is no longer under review (e.g., desk rejected, withdrawn) at ICLR before ACL-IJCNLP 2021's submission deadline and your de-anonymized paper is posted before January 1, 2021, you can submit your paper to ACL-IJCNLP 2021. Any de-anonymization after January 1 will not be eligible for re-submission to ACL-IJCNLP 2021.

### Q2: Our paper has already been accepted at a workshop. There are no formal proceedings for this workshop. We want to submit our work to ACL-IJCNLP 2021. Do we need to take any special steps to ensure its eligibility for ACL-IJCNLP 2021, for example, to ensure that the workshop does not post the paper online during the anonymity period?

A2: The goal of the anonymity period is to ensure double blind review. Thus, the workshop should not post the paper online during the anonymity period. It would be good that you contact the workshop organizers about this.

### Q3: Does the anonymity deadline of January 1, 2021 refer to the submission deadline or publication deadline for an arXiv submission?

A3: For arXiv submissions, January 1, 2021 11:59pm UTC-12h (anywhere on earth) is the submission deadline. The date stamp associated with the submission is the time that the final "Submit Article" step is completed. For other non-anonymized versions, it is the deadline when such a version becomes public.

### Q4: We post an arXiv preprint prior to the anonymity period, and we will not update/advertise it after anonymity begins. May we introduce upgrades to the associated web demo and the related GitHub repo during the anonymity period if we do not announce these upgrades in any way?
A4: As long as you don't update your arXiv preprint during the anonymity period, you won't be considered as violating the anonymity policy. That is, you can still update your web demo and a GitHub repo after anonymity begins.

### Q5: Can we submit a paper based on work reported previously in a talk?
A5: You are most welcome to submit your work to ACL-IJCNLP 2021 as long as the talk or the previous venue you submit work to does not have a formal proceedings, with an ISBN/ISSN/DOI or similar.

### Q6: Can we submit ACL-IJCNLP 2021 main conference papers to ACL-IJCNLP workshops?
A6: We allow papers dual-submitted to both ACL-IJCNLP 2021 main conference and its workshops.

### Q7: Can we submit ACL-IJCNLP 2021 papers to a non-archival workshop? The workshop will not have formal published proceedings, but will provide links to accepted papers.
A7: If your workshop paper is published online between January 1, 2021 and May 5, 2021, then you should not submit to ACL-IJCNLP 2021 due to its anonymity policy.

### Q8: In my paper submission, can I include a link to my source code at github?
A8: Please do not include github links that reveal the authors' identities in your submission. If you feel it is important to include your source code, you can zip the code and submit it to softconf. If your paper is accepted, you can include the github link in the camera-ready version.

## Page limit

### Q1: What is the page limit of theme papers? 
A1: Submission requirements for theme papers are the same as long papers.

### Q2: The call for papers says "Authors will be allowed extra space after the 8th page (4th for short papers) for a broader impact statement or other discussion of ethics." Does this mean that the impact statement will be not counted in the total page limit?
A2: The ethics/broader impact statement is not counted in the total page limit. You need to put the impact statement right before the references. Thus, the paper excluding the impact statement and references should not be over the page limit. 

### Q3: What is the page limit of the appendix?
A3: The page limit of the appendix is 4 pages.

### Q4: Should the appendix be submitted as a separate document?
A4: Yes. It should be submitted as a separate pdf file. It should not be included in the main paper.
