## Diversity & Inclusion Subsidies
ACL-IJCNLP 2021 is providing D&I funds for registration, caregiving, bandwidth and VPN subsidies. The grants are intended for individuals for whom attending the conference would cause a financial burden or create risks to their safety or privacy. Please apply by June 27, 2021 (2 weeks before the early registration deadline) at this link: [https://forms.gle/EekTNXekyHeKQpDY9](https://forms.gle/EekTNXekyHeKQpDY9). Informal enquiries can be made to [acl2021_div_incl@googlegroups.com](mailto:acl2021_div_incl@googlegroups.com).

*Registration subsidies:* This is for getting a waiver for ACL registration. If you haven't already registered for an *ACL in 2021, you would also need to pay the ACL membership registration fee, e.g. $100 for regular. You can also request for ACL membership if that's applicable. 

Note that if you are applying for a registration fee waiver, it is expected that you DO NOT register for the conference until you hear from us about your D&I subsidy application. That way, you would not have to ask for a reimbursement, since you would not be charged in the first place. We strongly encourage folks to apply for a volunteership program in order to maximize their chances for getting their registration fees waived.
