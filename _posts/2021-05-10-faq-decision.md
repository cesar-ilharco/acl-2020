The whole review process is quite complicated, and may be mysterious to many authors. Thus, we want to explain the process a little bit in Section 1 before answering more specific questions. 

## Section 1: The Review Process
Below are the main steps in the review process, which is very similar to those from previous conferences: 
<ol>
<li> 2/2-2/24: Paper check and AC/reviewer assignment
	<ol type="a">
	<li>Papers are assigned to tracks by Program Chairs (PCs) and checked by Senior Area Chairs (SACs) and PCs. Let's call these tracks the technical tracks, in contrast to the EAC track (see Step 3).</li> 
	<li>Three reviewers and one area chair (AC) are assigned to each paper.</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li> 2/25-3/20: Reviewers review papers 
	<ol type="a">
	<li>Reviews include two parts: non-confident part (which was sent to authors on March 25), and confident part visible only to ACs/SACs/PCs.</li>
	<li>If the reviewers or the AC had ethical concerns about the paper, they would "flag" the paper by clicking "yes" for the ethical question on the review form, and provide a justification for their concern.</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li> 3/21-3/24: EAC check and reviewer assignment
	<ol type="a">
	<li>PCs add the flagged papers to a special track for the Ethic Advisory Committee (EAC).</li>
	<li>EAC chairs then read the paper to determine whether it needs a full EAC review. If so, one or more EAC reviewers are assigned to the paper, and the EAC reviews would be due in mid-April.</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li> 4/1-4/7: Reviewer/AC discussion period
	<ol type="a">
	<li>The AC and reviewers of technical tracks discuss the paper in softconf's discussion board. The reviewers are asked to update their reviews in softconf if they change their opinions or have any new comments to add about the paper based on the discussion.</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li> 4/8-4/14: The AC writes a meta review which has three parts:
	<ol type="a">
	<li>AC recommendation, which uses one of four labels: 1-Accept, 2-Possible-Accept, 3-Possible-Reject, 4-Reject.</li>
	<li>AC summary of reviews  (including his/her own opinion) of the paper, which is visible to authors.</li>
	<li>AC's confidential comments to SACs/PCs.</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li> 4/15-4/24: SAC recommendation which also has three parts:
	<ol type="a">
	<li>SAC recommendation, which uses one of four labels: 1-Definite-Accept, 2-Possible-Accept-to-Main-Conference, 3-Possible-Accept-to-Findings, 4-Reject.</li>
	<li>SACs provide a ranking of papers with the 2-Possible-Accept-to-Main-Conference or 3-Possible-Accept-to-Findings recommendations.</li>
	<li>SACs' comments to PCs</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li> 3/25-4/24: EAC recommendation:
	<ol type="a">
	<li>EAC reviews are due in Mid-April.</li>
	<li>EAC chairs read the EAC reviews and inform PCs of their decisions, which include comments and one of three labels:
		<ol type="i">
		<li>E1: The paper does not have serious ethical issues</li>
		<li>E2: The paper has some serious ethical issues and thus, if the paper is accepted, the camera-ready version needs to be checked by EAC to ensure ethical concern has been addressed in that version.</li>
		<li>E3: The paper should be rejected due to ethical concerns.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li>4/25-5/5: PCs make final decisions:
	<ol type="a">
	<li>Based on the input from the technical tracks (reviews, discussion board, AC recommendation, SAC recommendation, etc.), PCs use one of three labels for each paper:
		<ol type="i">
		<li>P1: Accept-to-Main-Conference</li>
		<li>P2: Accept-to-Findings</li>
		<li>P3: Reject</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>For P1 or P2 papers (not P3 papers), EAC chairs write a meta review that highlights the changes that EAC recommends authors to make in the camera-ready version.</li>
	<li>For P1 or P2 papers, PCs will use the following four labels for the final decisions:
		<ol type="i">
		<li>If EAC recommendation is E1, the paper is accepted and the final label is Accept-P1 or Accept-P2.</li>
		<li>If EAC recommendation is E2, the paper is conditionally accepted, and the status is Accept-P1-condition or Accept-P2-condition.</li>
		<li>None of the papers get an E3 label from the EAC.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>For P3 papers, PCs will mark them as Reject-P3.</li>
	<li>PCs send out notifications to all authors.</li>
	</ol>
</li>
</ol>

Now, if you go to softconf, you can see your papers in one of five categories: 
- Accept-P1: accepted to the main conference
- Accept-P1-condition: conditionally accepted to the main conference
- Accept-P2: accepted to Findings
- Accept-P2-condition: conditionally accepted to Findings
- Reject-P3: reject

In summary, the final decision is based on the input from all the steps mentioned above:
- The submission itself and the author responses
- Reviews from 3+ reviewers: including the part visible to authors and confidential comments to ACs/SACs/PCs.
- AC recommendation: including a recommendation label, AC summary, and confidential comments to SACs/PCs.
- Reviewers/AC discussion messages in the softconf discussion board.
- SAC recommendation: including a recommendation label, rank of the papers in the area, and comments to PCs.
- EAC recommendation: including an EAC label (E1, E2, E3), EAC comments confidential to PCs, one or two EAC reviews, and an EAC meta review for accepted or conditionally accepted papers.

In addition, we target an acceptance rate of the main conference and the Findings to be around 21-24% and 15%, respectively.

## Section 2: Questions about the review process
This section includes questions that may be relevant to more than one category.

### Q1: How does the review process work?
A1: See Section 1

### Q2: The AC recommends Accept. Why is my paper still rejected?
A2: As explained in Section 1, AC recommendation is just one of many factors used in the final decision. For instance, some ACs disagree with reviewers: they may recommend Accept when some reviewers insist on the paper being rejected, or the other way around. PCs also look at other factors such as author rebuttal, three reviews, the discussion in the discussion board, SAC recommendations, EAC recommendations (for flagged papers), and the submission itself.

### Q3: My overall recommendation scores are 4, 3.5, 3.5. Why is my paper still rejected (or accepted to Findings, but not to the main conference)?
A3: Just like in Q2, review scores are just one of many factors considered by PCs. For instance, some ACs point out that in some reviews, the overall recommendation scores do not match the reviews (e.g., a largely negative review with a score of 3.5), but reviewers do not want to change their reviews or overall recommendation scores for various reasons, even when prompted by ACs. In that case, PCs read reviews, AC recommendation and SAC recommendation in order to reach a final decision.

### Q4: My reviews are largely positive but the paper is rejected due to an EAC review. Does EAC have the one-vote veto right?
A4: No. EAC recommendation is only one piece of information used in the final decision, as explained in Section 1.

### Q5: Where can we see revised reviews (or comments to our rebuttal)?
A5: The reviews sent to authors on May 5 are the revised reviews. If reviewers had some comments to the rebuttal that they wanted the authors to see, they would include that in their revised reviews. 

### Q6: How come the reviews remain the same after we spent so much time writing the rebuttal?
A6: Many reviewers were discussing the papers in the discussion board at softconf, and, after the reviewer/AC discussion, they decided to keep their original reviews because they were not convinced by the authors' rebuttal. In that case, the new reviews will be identical to the original ones.
