The whole review process is quite complicated, and may be mysterious to many authors. Thus, we want to explain the process a little bit in Section 1 before answering more specific questions. 

## Section 1: The Review Process
Below are the main steps in the review process, which is very similar to those from previous conferences: 
<ol>
<li> 2/2-2/24: Paper check and AC/reviewer assignment
	<ol>
	<li> Papers are assigned to tracks by Program Chairs (PCs) and checked by Senior Area Chairs (SACs) and PCs. Let’s call these tracks the technical tracks, in contrast to the EAC track (see Step 3). 
	<li> Three reviewers and one area chair (AC) are assigned to each paper.
