The whole review process is quite complicated, and may be mysterious to many authors. Thus, we want to explain the process a little bit in Section 1 before answering more specific questions. 

## Section 1: The Review Process
Below are the main steps in the review process, which is very similar to those from previous conferences: 
<ol>
<li> 2/2-2/24: Paper check and AC/reviewer assignment
	<ol type="a">
	<li>Papers are assigned to tracks by Program Chairs (PCs) and checked by Senior Area Chairs (SACs) and PCs. Let's call these tracks the technical tracks, in contrast to the EAC track (see Step 3).</li> 
	<li>Three reviewers and one area chair (AC) are assigned to each paper.</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li> 2/25-3/20: Reviewers review papers 
	<ol type="a">
	<li>Reviews include two parts: non-confident part (which was sent to authors on March 25), and confident part visible only to ACs/SACs/PCs.</li>
	<li>If the reviewers or the AC had ethical concerns about the paper, they would "flag" the paper by clicking "yes" for the ethical question on the review form, and provide a justification for their concern.</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li> 3/21-3/24: EAC check and reviewer assignment
	<ol type="a">
	<li>PCs add the flagged papers to a special track for the Ethic Advisory Committee (EAC).</li>
	<li>EAC chairs then read the paper to determine whether it needs a full EAC review. If so, one or more EAC reviewers are assigned to the paper, and the EAC reviews would be due in mid-April.</li>
	</ol>
</li>
</ol>
