## Rationale for the reviewer mentoring program
Given the rapid growth of NLP in terms of number of papers and new students, it is very important for our community to mentor and train new reviewers. Pursuant to this goal, ACL 2020 launched a pilot "reviewer mentoring program" which called for each Area Chair (AC) to mentor at least one first-time ACL reviewer. Ultimately, the goal was to provide mentoring to new reviewers entering the field to ensure lasting review quality as the growth of the field continued.
