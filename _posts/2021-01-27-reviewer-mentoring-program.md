## Rationale for the reviewer mentoring program
Given the rapid growth of NLP in terms of number of papers and new students, it is very important for our community to mentor and train new reviewers. Pursuant to this goal, ACL 2020 launched a pilot "reviewer mentoring program" which called for each Area Chair (AC) to mentor at least one first-time ACL reviewer. Ultimately, the goal was to provide mentoring to new reviewers entering the field to ensure lasting review quality as the growth of the field continued.

ACL-IJCNLP'21 will continue and evolve this program. First-time reviewers will continue to be mentored by an area chair (AC). They will also be asked to go through several training resources. First-time reviewers will be mandatorily enrolled to complete these training resources. After that, they will be paired on a voluntary basis with an AC to be their mentor.  To be mentored means that the first-time reviewer will have to submit one review (picked by SACs and the mentor together) two weeks before the standard review deadline to allow discussions with the mentor. This evolution of the reviewer mentoring program corresponds to the recommendation of the pilot experience at ACL'20.
