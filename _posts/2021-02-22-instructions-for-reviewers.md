##  ACL-IJCNLP 2021 Instructions for Reviewers

Thank you for agreeing to help in the reviewing process for ACL-IJCNLP 2021! In order to ensure that all valid submissions receive a fair and thorough review, we would like to bring your attention to a few guidelines for reviewing papers. Please read these instructions before you start reviewing papers. 
All reviewers are assigned no more than 6 reviews each. Since we have a joint long and short paper deadline, please be mindful that you may have a combination of long and short papers to review.

### Important Dates

Your reviews are due on Saturday, March 20, 2021 (11:59pm anywhere on Earth). The rebuttal period starts on March 25, thus it is crucial that you complete your assignments by March 20.

Please note that there is a reviewer discussion period from April 1 to 7 after the author response. Your duties are marked in bold. Don't leave reviewing to the last minute!
