##  ACL-IJCNLP 2021 Instructions for Reviewers

Thank you for agreeing to help in the reviewing process for ACL-IJCNLP 2021! In order to ensure that all valid submissions receive a fair and thorough review, we would like to bring your attention to a few guidelines for reviewing papers. Please read these instructions before you start reviewing papers. 
All reviewers are assigned no more than 6 reviews each. Since we have a joint long and short paper deadline, please be mindful that you may have a combination of long and short papers to review.

### Important Dates

Your reviews are due on Saturday, March 20, 2021 (11:59pm anywhere on Earth). The rebuttal period starts on March 25, thus it is crucial that you complete your assignments by March 20.

Please note that there is a reviewer discussion period from April 1 to 7 after the author response. Your duties are marked in bold. Don't leave reviewing to the last minute!

**Confidentiality**

Please note that the content of any submission to ACL-IJCNLP 2021 and the content of discussion about submissions, are confidential.

**The Review Form**

We adapt the review forms and the instructions from ACL 2020, EMNLP 2020 and NAACL 2021. The review form consists of four main sections.

**1. In-Depth Review.** This section is for you to give your overall assessment of the paper and to provide evidence to support your opinions. There are ten subsections:

- **The core review:** This is the most important part. It should include your view of the main contributions that the paper intends to make and how well it succeeds at making these contributions. From your point of view, what are the significant strong and weak parts of the paper and the work it describes? This could be a 2 paragraph (or longer) essay and/or a bullet list. Remember to describe how the work advances the state of knowledge in computational linguistics and/or highlights why it fails to make a sufficient contribution.

- **Reasons to accept:** Please briefly summarize from your core review the main reasons why this paper should be accepted for the conference, and how the ACL community would benefit from it. You may refer back to your review to provide more context and details.

- **Reasons to reject:** Please briefly summarize the main reasons that this paper cannot be published and presented in its current form. What are the parts that would need to be improved in order to advance the state of knowledge?

- **Reproducibility:** Following EMNLP 2020 and NAACL 2021, we provide a reproducibility checklist in an effort to increase reproducibility of the research work in NLP. In the review form. Please answer the following two questions.
	- "How do you rate the paper's reproducibility? Will members of the ACL community be able to reproduce or verify the results in this paper?" Scores of 1-5 are used to assess this aspect. The detailed explanation for each point level is provided in the review form. N/A may be used for the papers that do not include empirical results.
	- "Are the authors' answers to the reproducibility checklist useful for evaluating the submission?". Three choices are provided for this question (Very useful, Somewhat useful, and Not useful). Note that this question is for us to collect feedback regarding the usefulness of the reproducibility checklist, and is not about evaluating the paper itself.

- **Ethic review:** This year, authors are allowed extra space after the 8th page (or the 4th page for short papers) for a broader impact statement or other discussion of ethics. Regardless of whether the paper includes an impact statement, you need to read the whole paper carefully and determine whether the paper has some potential ethical issues. If that is the case, you should flag the paper by choosing "yes" to the "ethical concerns" question. The flagged papers will then be reviewed by an Ethics Advisory Committee (EAC).
	- Please read the FAQ for ethical discussion standards and the questions in the ethics section of the review form for more guidance on some problems to look out for and key concerns to consider relative to the code of ethics.
	- If you flag a paper, it is very important that you provide justification as detailed as possible to help EAC to understand your concern. 
	- Note that more than 30% of the submissions include ethics/impact statements, and most of them are unlikely to have ethical issues. Therefore, please read the statements and use your best judgment to determine whether the paper should be flagged. Please don't automatically flag a paper simply because it includes an ethics/impact statement. 
	- Regardless of whether you flag a paper, you should review the paper carefully and answer the rest of the questions on the review form.

- Anonymity requirement: Please indicate whether you know the identity of some authors of this paper. If yes, please provide more details (e.g., the url of the version posted online) in the "Author identify justification" box. 

- Overall recommendation: Here you are asked to synthesize the above and come up with your own recommendation for the paper.
	- Like ACL 2020, we have used a 5-point scale with a half point increments. The detailed explanation for each point level is provided in the review form. These numbers are just a concise way of expressing your overall opinion and relative importance of the factors mentioned above.
	- Different from ACL 2020, we are allowing a rating of 3 (ambivalent). Please try to take a stand on whether the paper is above or below the borderline, e.g., by selecting 2.5 or 3.5. However, if you think this is indeed a borderline paper or you are not able to decide, you should use 3.
	- Decisions will be made not just on the scores and certainly not on average scores, but will also take into account the whole review, reviewer discussion and area chair meta-reviews and recommendations. However, it is important to align your recommendation with the reasoning given above, so that authors will be able to understand the motivation for the recommendations and how decisions were arrived at.
