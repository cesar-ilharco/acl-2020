Registration
We anticipate registration opening early in the week of June 20th.  Please check back here for when it will be available.

For planning purposes, we hope to set registration fees similar to those charged for the virtual ACL 2020.  The one fee allows attendance at the main conference and any/all tutorials and workshops.  These fees would be $125 Regular Early and $175 Regular Late; $50 Student Early and $75 Student Late.  We estimate early registration closes at midnight July 11, 2021.

Reminders:  It is ACL's policy that at least one author of each accepted paper (including ACL Finding papers) must register for the conference. 

## Registration Types
- Regular  
- Student
- I am a Volunteer (student or non-student)
- I am a D&I Award Recipient
- I am an SRW Award Recipient
- I am an invited Conference Organizer (Invited by the General Chair or Local Arrangements)

## ACL Membership
The ACL policy is that everyone attending an ACL conference must be a current (CY 2021) ACL member. So, in addition to the above registration fee, each Regular will add $100 membership fee to their registration and each Student will add $50 membership fee to their registration if not already a 2021 paid member. ACL membership is for the entire calendar year, providing membership in the society devoted to promoting CL research throughout the world, open access to the CL and TACL Journals and ACL Anthology as well as access to other ACL conferences in the same year without paying membership again. Membership also entitles you to electronic notification of new issues of the journals, discounts on publications from participating publishers, announcements of ACL and related conferences, workshops, and journal calls of interest to the community.

## Reduced Rate Memberships
The ACL offers a discount to members from developing countries. We hope this discount will allow for more people from these countries to become a part of the ACL and enjoy its benefits. To be able to benefit from reduced rate memberships, you need to become a member through the ACL Member Portal. You can then register for the conference as a current member.
