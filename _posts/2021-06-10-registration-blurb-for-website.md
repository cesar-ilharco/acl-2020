Registration
We anticipate registration opening early in the week of June 20th.  Please check back here for when it will be available.

For planning purposes, we hope to set registration fees similar to those charged for the virtual ACL 2020.  The one fee allows attendance at the main conference and any/all tutorials and workshops.  These fees would be $125 Regular Early and $175 Regular Late; $50 Student Early and $75 Student Late.  We estimate early registration closes at midnight July 11, 2021.

Reminders:  It is ACL's policy that at least one author of each accepted paper (including ACL Finding papers) must register for the conference.
