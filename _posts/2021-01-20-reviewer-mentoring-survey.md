### Rationale for the reviewer mentoring program survey
ACL-IJCNLP'21 will provide a mentoring program service to first-time reviewers. We are about to publish detailed information on this blog in the upcoming few days. In today's blog post we want to share with the community a survey we conducted towards Senior Area Chairs and Area Chairs. During our mentoring program preparations, we asked SACs and ACs what they expect of reviews, including impact of code, appendices and data, the expected reviewing time per paper, what they would want to see in a reviewing tutorial video towards first-time reviewers, what they expect from the rebuttal phase. 

*Because some of these questions and answers are beyond the sole scope of the reviewer mentoring program, and probably of interest to all colleagues, we want to publicly share here the main results of that survey.*

We first want to thank all **130 Senior Area Chairs and Area Chairs** (24 SAC and 104 ACs) who took the time to answer this survey. A couple of questions were open questions and are not included in the statistical feedback here. We thank our SACs and ACs for this: many submitted many helpful comments in answer to the open questions "how to evaluate when there are enough experiments for leaning towards acceptance?" and "What should such a video tutorial(s) cover besides what is mentioned above? (which important aspect we missed?)"). Your input was carefully read, and it will influence how we proceed this year.

On multiple choice questions, we first asked SACs and ACs to rank some ideas we had in mind to be included in a general reviewing tutorial video for first-time reviewers. The question was as follows: "We plan to make video tutorial(s) for new reviewers (PhD 2nd, 3rd years mostly). What should be the video tutorial priorities among the following topics? Sort from most important (top) to least important (bottom)."
